I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (MS EECS) at the University of California, Merced. 
 
Before starting my MS, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Communications Engineering at RGPV-UIT in India.  During my undergraduate studies, my coursework included , <b> Digital Circuits, Design & Analysis of Algorithms, Internet of Things, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Statistics, Microwave Engineering</b>. 

##  **Work Experience:**
In terms of work experience, I had the opportunity to work as a <b>Backend Software Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services Limited</b>.  I contributed to integrating various payment settling systems like Direct Debit, Credit Transfers and E-Mandates, streamlining payment processes,  reducing transaction settlement times. Moreover, I orchestrated the deployment of mock webservices using Spring Boot applications using Scrum, Agile Methodology, Java, and Maven.

I also am currently working as a Graduate Student Researcher in UC Merced's <a href="https://www.mocalab.org/moca-lab"> MoCA Lab </a>. My work in the lab includes developing and optimizing Deep Learning vision algrorithms for use on the Nvidia Orin AGX embedded platform.

##  **Projects:**
A project I'm proud of is <b>"Efficient Person Following Robot algorithms</b>", where I am developing an architecture for person following and tracking using Pose estimation and Person detection. I am currently optimizing current SOTA methods to work efficiently on embedded platforms like Nvidia Orin AGX.

Another recent project that i completed was LLM Prompt prediction. The goal of this project was to predict a prompt, ‚ü®Rewrite Prompt‚ü©, that was used to generate ‚ü®Rewritten Text‚ü© by providing only ‚ü®Original Text‚ü©-‚ü®Rewritten Text‚ü© pairs to the LLM. At inference, it predicts an embedding using the ‚ü®Original Text‚ü© and the ‚ü®Rewritten Text‚ü©. The finetuned models ranked 986 out of 2186. The best leaderboard score was our Phi-2 submission which scored 0.6188. The Mixtral 8x7B model finetuned with 1000 samples scored 0.6056 and Gemma 7B finetuned with 5000 samples scored 0.5981. 

## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages & Databases**: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, SQL, Postgre SQL, Oracle SQL, IBM Db2
- **Tools**: Git, Jenkins, Docker, Colab, Maven, Jupyter
- **Frameworks**: Express.js, ROS, Spring, Spring Boot, FastAPI
- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow

##  **Hackathon Experience:**
- Won 2nd prize (worth $5000) in Sentient's Werewolf AGI-thon for developing a Llama 2 70B agent capable of playing the social deduction game of Werewolf.
- Won 1st prize nationwide in Smart India Hackathon 2018 (Hardware Editon) for developing a Computer Vision based real-time road traffic mangement system.
- Was selected in top 5 teams natiowide in TCS Finorama Fintech challenge 2018.

##  **Extracurricular Activities:**
- Served as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 015: Discrete Mathematics at UC Merced, where i conducted and managed labs for 90 undergradute students.

Please feel free to get in touch with me, I'm excited to connect and collaborate in Software developement, machine learning, and beyond.
